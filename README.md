# Community-Banners-2.0
The Golang redesign of the former Laravel project. Adds in tagged(board specific) banners. <br/>
Project uses Golang Gin framework for creating REST API. Much more focused and specific on the banner server's primary function, JSON responses and modifying or serving data on API request. <br/>
Designed to be mixed with NGINX for serving static content.
## Why not Laravel?
Maintaining laravel projects is a pain and PHP is a dead fish.
## Why Twig Templates
Kissu.moe has many Twig templates that would need to be ported. This is a test of what aspects of Twig are existent on Golang.
## Why Gin
It's good at making REST API. React applications use this a lot.
## Damn, this is really good and I think you should be paid

Alternatively consider making a thread on <a href="kissu.moe">kissu.moe</a> and possitively engage with the community. None of that toxic BS that imageboards are known for.
