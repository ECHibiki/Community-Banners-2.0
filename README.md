# Community-Banners-2.0
The Golang redesign of the former Laravel project. Adds in tagged(board specific) banners. <br/>
Project uses Golang Gin framework for creating REST API. Much more focused and specific on the banner server's primary function, JSON responses and modifying or serving data on API request. <br/>
Designed to be mixed with NGINX for serving static content.
